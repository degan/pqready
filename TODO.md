## 🟢 Nice-to-Have Features

### 7. Batch Processing
- [ ] Implement file-based URL input (mentioned in README TODO)
- [ ] Add concurrent processing with configurable limits
- [ ] Progress indicators for batch operations
- [ ] Summary statistics for batch results

### 8. Enhanced CLI Features

### 11. Code Coverage & Analysis
- [ ] Add `cargo tarpaulin` for coverage reporting
- [ ] Set up coverage thresholds in CI
- [ ] Add `cargo machete` for unused dependency detection
- [ ] Implement `cargo deny` for license/security checking

### 12. Fuzzing & Security
- [ ] Add fuzzing tests for TLS message parser
- [ ] Security audit of custom TLS implementation
- [ ] Add property tests for cryptographic functions
- [ ] Memory safety analysis with `cargo miri`

## 📚 Documentation

### 13. Code Documentation
- [ ] Add inline examples to public functions
