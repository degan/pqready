## Security Considerations

This tool performs network connections and TLS analysis. Please be aware:

- **Network Traffic**: The tool sends TLS handshake requests to target servers
- **DNS Queries**: Hostname resolution is performed using system DNS
- **Local Execution**: The tool runs with user privileges and does not require elevated access
- **Data Handling**: No sensitive data is stored or transmitted beyond the TLS handshake process

## Scope

Security reports should focus on:
- Remote code execution vulnerabilities
- Memory safety issues
- Cryptographic implementation flaws
- Input validation bypasses
- Privilege escalation

Out of scope:
- Denial of service via resource exhaustion
- Issues requiring physical access to the machine
- Social engineering attacks

Thank you for helping keep pqready secure!
