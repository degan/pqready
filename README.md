# pqready - Quantum Security Scanner

A cross-platform CLI tool to test TLS/HTTPS servers for quantum-secure encryption support, specifically the `X25519MLKEM768` key exchange algorithm introduced in Apple's latest operating systems.

## Overview

Based on Apple's quantum-secure encryption specifications from [iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26 and visionOS 26](https://support.apple.com/en-my/122756), this tool tests whether HTTPS servers support hybrid, quantum-secure key exchange algorithms that are designed to protect against future quantum computer attacks.

## Features

- ‚úÖ **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- üîç **TLS Analysis**: Detailed analysis of TLS connections and cipher suites
- üõ°Ô∏è **Quantum Security Detection**: Tests for X25519MLKEM768 key exchange support
- üé® **Colorized Output**: Easy-to-read results with color coding
- üìä **JSON Output**: Machine-readable output format
- ‚ö° **Async Operations**: Fast, non-blocking network operations
- üïí **Configurable Timeouts**: Customizable connection timeouts

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70 or later
- Cargo package manager

### Building from Source

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd pqready

# Using Make (recommended)
make release

# Or using Cargo directly
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be available at `target/release/pqready` (or `target/release/pqready.exe` on Windows).

### Install from Cargo

```bash
cargo install pqready
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Test a single URL
pqready https://example.com

# Test with verbose output
pqready -v https://example.com

# Test with JSON output
pqready -j https://example.com

# Test with custom timeout
pqready -t 30 https://example.com
```

### Command Line Options

```
pqready [OPTIONS] <URL>

Arguments:
  <URL>  The HTTPS URL to test

Options:
  -v, --verbose          Enable verbose output
  -j, --json            Output results in JSON format
  -t, --timeout <SECONDS> Connection timeout in seconds [default: 10]
  -h, --help            Print help
  -V, --version         Print version
```

### Examples

#### Basic Test
```bash
$ pqready https://google.com

üîç Quantum Security Test Results
URL: https://google.com/
Quantum-secure encryption: ‚ùå NOT SUPPORTED
```

#### Verbose Output
```bash
$ pqready -v https://example.com

üîç Quantum Security Scanner
Testing: https://example.com/
Timeout: 10s

üîå Connecting to example.com:443
üì° Resolved to: 93.184.216.34:443
ü§ù TCP connection established
üîê TLS handshake completed
üîë Cipher suite: TLS13_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
üìã TLS version: TLSv1_3
üõ°Ô∏è  Quantum-secure: NO

üîç Quantum Security Test Results
URL: https://example.com/
Quantum-secure encryption: ‚ùå NOT SUPPORTED
TLS Version: TLSv1_3
Cipher Suite: TLS13_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
Key Exchange: Unknown
```

#### JSON Output
```bash
$ pqready -j https://example.com
{
  "url": "https://example.com/",
  "supports_quantum": false,
  "tls_version": "TLSv1_3",
  "cipher_suite": "TLS13_AES_256_GCM_SHA384",
  "key_exchange": "Unknown",
  "error": null
}
```

## Technical Details

### Quantum-Secure Encryption

This tool tests for the `X25519MLKEM768` key exchange algorithm, which is a hybrid approach combining:

- **X25519**: Classical elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman
- **ML-KEM-768**: Post-quantum key encapsulation mechanism

This hybrid approach provides:
- **Current security**: Protection against classical computers
- **Future security**: Protection against quantum computers
- **Compatibility**: Fallback to classical algorithms when quantum-secure ones aren't supported

### Supported Platforms

- **Windows**: Windows 10 and later
- **macOS**: macOS 10.15 and later  
- **Linux**: Most modern distributions

### Limitations

- Currently, most servers do not support `X25519MLKEM768`
- The quantum-secure algorithms are still being deployed across the internet
- This tool provides a foundation that will become more useful as server adoption increases
