# pqready - Post-Quantum TLS Validator

A cross-platform CLI tool to test TLS/HTTPS servers for quantum-secure encryption support, specifically the `X25519MLKEM768` key exchange algorithm introduced in Apple's latest operating systems.

## Overview

Based on Apple's quantum-secure encryption specifications from [iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26 and visionOS 26](https://support.apple.com/en-my/122756), this tool tests whether HTTPS servers support hybrid, quantum-secure key exchange algorithms that are designed to protect against future quantum computer attacks.

## Features

- ‚úÖ **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- üîç **TLS Analysis**: Detailed analysis of TLS connections and cipher suites
- üõ°Ô∏è **Quantum Security Detection**: Tests for X25519MLKEM768 key exchange support
- üé® **Colorized Output**: Easy-to-read results with color coding
- üìä **JSON Output**: Machine-readable output format
- ‚ö° **Async Operations**: Fast, non-blocking network operations
- üïí **Configurable Timeouts**: Customizable connection timeouts

## Technical Details

### Quantum-Secure Encryption

This tool tests for the `X25519MLKEM768` key exchange algorithm, which is a hybrid approach combining:

- **X25519**: Classical elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman
- **ML-KEM-768**: Post-quantum key encapsulation mechanism

This hybrid approach provides:
- **Current security**: Protection against classical computers
- **Future security**: Protection against quantum computers
- **Compatibility**: Fallback to classical algorithms when quantum-secure ones aren't supported

### Supported Platforms

- **Windows**: Windows 10 and later
- **macOS**: macOS 10.15 and later  
- **Linux**: Most modern distributions

### Limitations

- Currently, most servers do not support `X25519MLKEM768`
- The quantum-secure algorithms are still being deployed across the internet
- This tool provides a foundation that will become more useful as server adoption increases

When you push the tag, GitHub Actions will automatically:
- ‚úÖ Build binaries for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- ‚úÖ Create GitHub release with binaries attached
- ‚úÖ Use CHANGELOG content as release notes
- ‚úÖ Run all CI checks

#### 6. Publish to Crates.io (Optional)
